# Lang-SAM for text-prompt detection (from GitHub)
# NOTE: Commented out due to:
# 1. Conflicts with FastSAM (gradio version incompatibility)
# 2. Has known tensor dimension errors (not working)
# 3. FastSAM is the recommended alternative

# FastSAM - Alternative SAM implementation (YOLOv8-based, faster and more stable)

# Note: No need for standalone fastsam package - Ultralytics 8.0+ includes FastSAM
